# Docker has an issue (https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/1470) where it
# doesn't fully respect the resolv.conf dns servers and if the first dns server
# fails, it doesn't retry other servers. This script will try to switch
# consecutive nameservers to ensure the first one will resolve index.docker.io.
# This workaround method is relatively fragile on the environment, although the
# patching script is fairly stable. Upstream docker is apparently fixed, but
# not yet released, nor has it made it into our dependency pipelines. We
# heavily use Docker in our Jenkins deployments, so we've committed it here.
